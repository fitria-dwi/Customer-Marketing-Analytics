iFood is an online food ordering and delivery service in Brazil. The company has had solid revenue over the past three years.

To overcome this challenge, the company is exploring strategic initiatives to reverse this situation by enhancing its marketing campaign performance. By uncovering valuable insights, the company wants to drive and optimize marketing campaigns for sustained growth.
